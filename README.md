## Introduction

Template Image Processing Library (TIPL) is a lightweight C++ template library designed mainly for medical imaging processing. The design paradigm is to provide an "easy-to-use" and also "ready-to-use" header-only library.

## Design paradigm

Most image processing libraries are not designed for medical image analysis and have suboptimal performance. TIPL was developed for high-performance medical analysis. The design paradigm follows several coding guidelines and principles that make it highly efficient and reusable. 

The following is the main paradigm behind TIPL:

- Decouple image type and image processing method: 
Most of the image processing libraries are limited to their defined image type. TIPL is not. You may use a pointer or any kind of memory block to as the input. This reduces unnecessary memory storage and copy.

- Not limited to RGB pixel type: 
In medical imaging, the most common pixel type is "short" or "float", not the RGB value. TIPL makes no assumption on the pixel type to achieve the best applicability.

- Minimize class inheritance:
Class inheritance is known to cause difficulties in code maintenance and unfriendly for extensions. TIPL uses template variable coupling to minimize the need for inheritance unless a strong case for inheritance is suggested. This provide a "flat" library structures that is easy to maintain and modify. 

- Minimize between-header dependency:
TIPL couples function and type at very late stage in the cpp to reduce header dependency. This allows for fast compilation time and achieve better abstraction. 

- Avoid using plateform dependency functions or syntax:
TIPL will be compiled against MSVC, CLANG, and GCC to ensure the best cross-platform capability.

## Installation

TIPL is header only. You may clon the repo or use CMake to install the package.

1. Get header files from Github

```
!git clone http://github.com/frankyeh/TIPL/
```

2. Include the header 

```
#include "TIPL/tipl.hpp"  
```

Now you can use TIPL

### Building the C++ examples using CMake

It is possible to install TIPL using CMake, in which case C++ packages using CMake can easily build with it. 
In this package C++ examples are available in the `cpp` subdirectory. To build these using CMake:

* Make sure TIPL is installed with CMake, e.g. in a directory called `<TIPL_install_directory>`  (see the TIPL README.md file how to do this).
* Execute the commands from the root of your cloned `TIPL-example` directory:
```bash$
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<TIPL_install_directory>:$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
mkdir build ; cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
cd cpp
```
* At this point one should be able to execute the exmaple, e.g.:
```bash$
./linear_reg
```
* We also made a directory `cpp/TIPL-examples` and symbolic linked the source `data` directory there so that the exmaples can find their inputs.

Naturally one can also locate the CMake TIPLConfig.cmake file using other CMake means than `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` e.g. by providing the CMake option: `-DTIPL_DIR=<TIPL_install_directory>/lib/cmake/TIPL` to cmake. One should also be able to build out of source (the `build` directory can really be anywhere). 

Installation of the examples is not yet supported
